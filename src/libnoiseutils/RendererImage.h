        /// colors between two adjacent gradient points are linearly interpolated.

        /// between 0.0 (mapped to green) and 1.0 (mapped to white).

        /// between -1.0 (mapped to dark blue) and -0.2 (mapped to light blue).
        ///
        /// The color gradient requires a minimum of two gradient points.

        /// This class contains two pre-made gradients: a grayscale gradient and a
        /// color gradient suitable for terrain.  To use these pre-made gradients,
