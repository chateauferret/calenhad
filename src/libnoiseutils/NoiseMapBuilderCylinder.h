/// This class builds a noise map by filling it with coherent-noise values
/// generated from the surface of a cylinder.
///
/// This class describes these input values using an (angle, height)
/// coordinate system.  After generating the coherent-noise value from the
/// input value, it then "flattens" these coordinates onto a plane so that
/// it can write the values into a two-dimensional noise map.
///
/// The cylinder model has a radius of 1.0 unit and has infinite height.
/// The cylinder is oriented along the @a y axis.  Its center is at the
/// origin.
///
/// The x coordinate in the noise map represents the angle around the
/// cylinder's y axis.  The y coordinate in the noise map represents the
/// height above the x-z plane.
///
/// The application must provide the lower and upper angle bounds of the
/// noise map, in degrees, and the lower and upper height bounds of the
/// noise map, in units.
